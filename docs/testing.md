# Testing

## Unit tests

Launcher settings, version parsing and the updater have unit tests, the same
job CI runs:

```sh
ninja -C build unit_tests && ctest --test-dir build -L melee --output-on-failure
```

CI also runs `python3 tools/check_style.py` and `python3 tools/compile_check.py`
on every push (see [CODING_STYLE.md](../CODING_STYLE.md)).

## Smoke tests

`tools/smoke_test.py` is the automated end-to-end pass: a table of cases, each
one a subprocess run with a fixed argv and environment, judged on the exit
status plus required and forbidden regexes over the run's output. It needs only
the standard library.

```sh
python3 tools/smoke_test.py --no-disc     # CLI only: no disc image, no GPU
python3 tools/smoke_test.py               # everything
python3 tools/smoke_test.py --case vs-match
python3 tools/smoke_test.py --list
```

The disc comes from `MELEE_DISC`, defaulting to `../melee.ciso` beside the
checkout. Exit status is 0 only when every case passed. A failing case keeps its
temporary directory and prints the path; a passing one deletes it (each GPU run
leaves a ~75 MB pipeline cache behind).

**Nothing here depends on synthetic input or on pixels.** `devctl.py key` drops
keypresses on this machine and `import -window` can return a stale composited
frame, so neither can decide pass/fail. Scenes are reached with
`MELEE_BOOT_SCENE` and every run is bounded by `MELEE_EXIT_AFTER_FRAMES`, which
is what makes the frame count a fixed number two runs can be compared on.

Each run gets a throwaway `XDG_DATA_HOME`, so `SDL_GetPrefPath` lands in a temp
directory and the real memory card under `$HOME` is never touched. `HOME` itself
is deliberately left alone: overriding it loses `XAUTHORITY` and the x11 video
driver then refuses to start. `MELEE_FILES_DIR` is pointed at a nonexistent
path so the file cache cannot silently prefer a checked-out `iso/extracted_usa`
tree over the disc image.

### The two env knobs the harness needs

- `MELEE_EXIT_AFTER_FRAMES=<n>` — after `n` frames, leave the frame loop through
  the same path a window close takes (`pc_exit_requested` in `src/pc/vi.c`, so
  `atexit(pc_shutdown_once)` still runs), exit 0, and log
  `MELEE_EXIT_AFTER_FRAMES: reached frame <n>, exiting`. This is what makes a
  case bounded: a hang fails on the per-case timeout instead of hanging CI.
- `MELEE_BOOT_SCENE=<title|vs|classic|training>` — boot straight into one scene
  with a hard-coded setup, no menu navigation. It starts the state machine in
  that mode instead of routing through `GM_BOOT`, whose memory-card scene burns
  a mode-dependent and wildly variable number of frames (under 300 ahead of
  `GM_TITLE`, over 1800 ahead of `GM_CLASSIC`). `vs` is `GM_DEBUG_VS`, which is
  already a fixed direct start (`onEnterDebugVs`: Link vs Mario on Final
  Destination). `classic` and `training` open on a character select, so their
  `on_load` hooks seed the pick the way the select screen's exit would and jump
  past it — Mario in Classic, Mario vs a Link CPU on Battlefield in Training.
  While the knob is set, the state machine also logs `boot scene: game mode <n>`
  and `boot scene: state <n> scene <n>` per entry. Both knobs cost one `getenv`
  when unset.

### What each case proves

| case | proves |
| --- | --- |
| `cli-version` | `--version` prints a version and exits 0 |
| `cli-help` | `--help` prints usage and exits 2 |
| `cli-unknown-option` | an unknown flag is named, not ignored |
| `cli-two-discs` | a second disc argument is rejected (both paths exist, so this cannot pass by failing to open the first) |
| `cli-dvd-no-path` | `--dvd` with nothing after it is a usage error |
| `cli-missing-disc` | a nonexistent disc path exits 2 with the path named |
| `launcher-startup` | with no disc the launcher comes up (backend, RmlUi, fonts) and shuts down clean |
| `launcher-close-repeat` | three open/close cycles in one pref dir; a shutdown race shows up on a later pass, not the first |
| `backend-unknown-falls-back` | an unknown `MELEE_BACKEND` lists the valid names and continues on auto instead of failing |
| `title-boot` | the title screen runs 900 frames and exits clean |
| `vs-match` | `GM_DEBUG_VS` reaches `GS_VS` and runs 1500 frames |
| `classic-mode` | Classic gets past its intro into the first fight (`state 1 scene 2`) and runs 1800 frames |
| `training-mode` | Training reaches `GS_TRAINING` and runs 1500 frames |
| `disc-inspection` | the image parsed, the FST walked, and the region-specific archives on it are the NTSC-U ones |
| `memcard-create-and-load` | pass 1 creates the card image in the temp pref dir, pass 2 loads it from there |
| `memcard-no-card` | `--no-card` leaves the game with no save file to open |
| `audio-init` | the AX mixer callback is running against the output clock with voices actually mixing (`MELEE_AUDIO_STATS`) |
| `window-close` | a real `WM_DELETE_WINDOW` exits 0 (runs `tools/test_window_close.py`, which needs X11 and python-xlib) |

Every case additionally fails on `PANIC`, `[FATAL]`, `received signal`, a failed
assertion, or an unexplained `Device lost`. `Device lost ... Device was
destroyed` is aurora's own teardown line and appears on every clean exit, so
only an unexplained loss counts.

Expected frame counts live in the case table (the `frames` column of the output,
and `SCENES` in the script). They were measured, not guessed: each is a count
verified to reach that scene's state. Two runs of the full harness print
identical frame counts.

There is no CLI entry point that verifies a disc, and adding a flag only the
test uses would be backwards: the SHA-1 check is covered by the `launcher_data`
unit test (`tools/test_launcher_data.cpp`). `disc-inspection` asserts on what a
real boot observably does with the image instead.

## Running the game under test

- `tools/run.sh <disc>` runs under gdb and dumps all threads on a crash.
- `tools/demo_run.sh <seed> [secs]` enters the attract demo and reports survival
  or crash frames; `tools/demo_sweep.sh <seeds...>` batches it. `MELEE_SEED=<n>`
  makes the attract demo's RNG deterministic.
- `tools/devctl.py key|hold|shot` drives and captures the game window under X11.
- `tools/run_dbg.sh <disc>` adds a FIFO/PAD state dump on interrupt.
- `tools/gen_pipeline_cache.py` merges this machine's `pipeline_cache.db` into
  the shipped seed `tools/initial_pipeline_cache.db.gz`; `--run <disc>` records
  attract demos first. Play the menus, Classic and the cast by hand before
  merging, since the seed only covers what has been drawn.
- `tools/test_*.py` are targeted regression probes (hitlag, Home-Run collision,
  widescreen maths, vertex arrays, audio streaming, Stadium completion, ...).
  Most compile a sibling `tools/test_*.c` with the build's real flags from
  `build/compile_commands.json` and run it; the gdb-driven ones say what they
  need in their docstring.

`import -window` can keep returning the last composited frame under Xwayland while
the game presents normally, which looks like a freeze and is not one. `devctl.py
shot` detects two identical captures and nudges the window; when a screenshot and
a backtrace disagree, believe the backtrace.

## Harnesses for port bugs

Three harnesses find the next batch of the bug classes listed in
[porting-notes.md](porting-notes.md). Validate any sweep by re-introducing one
known-true positive and checking the count moves by exactly one.

- Whole-tree warning sweep: compile every TU for real (`-Wreturn-type` is not
  emitted under `-fsyntax-only`), strip the build's `-Wno-all -Wno-extra`, pass
  `-fdiagnostics-color=never`, and add `-Warray-bounds=2 -Wstringop-overflow=2
  -Wformat-overflow=2 -Wbool-operation`.
- `python3 tools/lint_sweep.py` compiles every game TU with `-m32 -DLINT`, which
  turns `ASSERT_SIZE` and `ASSERT_OFFSET` into real checks against the GameCube
  ABI. A failure means the struct reconstruction is wrong, not the port.
- `python3 tools/compile_check.py <files|dirs>` syntax-checks with the build's
  exact flags. Fast, so use it before a full build.

For "does this union view still alias on LP64", build one probe TU of the real
headers twice with the project's flags, native and `-m32`, then diff member
offsets and sizes out of DWARF (`gdb -batch -ex 'ptype /o T'`). Compare byte-range
intersections, not start offsets.
