"""Compile every game TU with `-m32 -DLINT` and report failing size/offset asserts.

The decomp's ASSERT_SIZE / ASSERT_OFFSET are no-ops on TARGET_PC (they are
gated on MUST_MATCH || LINT). Under `-m32 -DLINT` they become real checks
against the GameCube ABI, so a failure means the struct *reconstruction* is
wrong, independently of anything the port changed. Expected failures are
listed in EXPECTED below; anything else is new.

usage: lint_sweep.py [build-dir]   (default: build)
