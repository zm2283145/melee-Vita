# Compiler gate. Include right after project(); it runs at include time.

# The game reads on-disc structures through
# __attribute__((scalar_storage_order("big-endian"))), which only GCC
# implements, and only for C. Clang accepts the syntax and ignores it, so a
# Clang build compiles clean and then reads every disc field byte-swapped.
#
# Android, Apple and Windows-ARM64 keep Clang for the C++ and route the game's
# C through GCC (tools/gcc_launcher.py, tools/gcc_ios_launcher.py,
# tools/gcc_windows_arm64_launcher.py), so CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID is Clang there
# on purpose and the gate does not apply.
